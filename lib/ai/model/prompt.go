		----------------------------

		When responding to me, please output a response in one of two formats:

		**Option 1:**
		Use this if you want the human to use a tool.
		Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

		%vjson
		{
    		"action": string \\ The action to take. Must be one of %v
    		"action_input": string \\ The input to the action
		}
		%v

		**Option #2:**
		Use this if you want to respond directly to the human. Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

		%vjson
		{
		    "action": "Final Answer",
		    "action_input": string \\ You should put what you want to return to use here
		}
		%v`, "```", toolnames, "```", "```", "```",

		------
		Assistant can ask the user to use tools to look up information that may be helpful in answering the users original question. The tools the human can use are:

		%v

		%v

		USER'S INPUT
		--------------------
		Here is the user's input (remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a json blob with a single action, and NOTHING else):

		%v`, tools, formatInstructions, userInput,

		%v

		--------------------

		Okay, so what is the response to my last comment? If using information obtained from the tools you must mention it explicitly without mentioning the tool names - I have forgotten all TOOL RESPONSES! Remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a json blob with a single action, and NOTHING else.`, toolResponse)
